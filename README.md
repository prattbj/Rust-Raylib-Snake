# Overview

I wanted to learn Rust since it is suppsoed to be a memory-safe alternative to C++. To do this, I made the snake game.

# Development Environment

I used the Raylib-rs library and CLion with the Rust extension.

# Future Work

* Rewrite the game loop so that it looks nicer

* Change the speed of the gameplay
